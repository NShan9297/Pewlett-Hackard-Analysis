# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# ** Overview** #

Pewlett-Hackard is coming up on the "Silver Tsunami" where a large group of Baby Boomers getting ready for retirement. Bobby from Human Resources needs help with getting a count of how many employees are retiring thus eligible for their retirement package. They also need to figure out how many roles will need to be filled after the retirement aged people leave. Bobby has also asked that we figure out how many employees could be brought on as Mentors for new hires. The group chosen for this was current employees that are on their way to retirement to see how many people may be able to be recruited.

# ** Results ** #
4 major results:

- there will be nearly 73,000 employees eligible for retirement 

- there will be ~2% of the retiring emplolyees available to become Mentors 

- the bulk of the retiring group are senior members

- there are no managers eligible to be Mentors 



# ** Summary ** #

** How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? **

Using the Count()function, we were able to get a count for each title of those that are of retirement age. The total is 72,528-assuming that this number will be met, there will need to be this many roles filled. This is also assuming that every mentor will be working exclusively as mentors and not continuing with any of their previous day-to-day obligations



** Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? **

overall, assuming that every new hire will need a one on one mentor/mentee relationship there will not be enough mentors for the next generation. 
There will be 1,549 eligible mentors and 72,528 roles will need to be filled 

by department-we can also see that there will be a deficit:

If the Mentors are able to take on groups, there would be 
about 61 new employees for every Senior Staff Mentor
about 23 new employees for every Engineer mentor
about 24 new employees for every Staff mentor
about 87 new employees for every Senior Engineer mentor 
about 46 new employees for every Technique Leader mentor
about 18 new employees for every Assistant Engineer mentor

Some roles may be able to mentor larger groups while some may not.
